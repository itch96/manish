NOTE:	itch.jar may look like it's not responding if the xlsx file is large and there are 	a lot of photos.
	Don't worry, it is working in the background. To confirm, you can go to the 		Destination Folder that you provide in the app. You will be able to see the folder 	populate itself with folders according to the xlsx file.
