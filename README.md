> No need to download the entire thing. Just download the Application folder. 😄

====================INSTRUCTIONS====================

Step 1) Download the java JRE for your machine(x86, or x64) from the link 	
	      http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html
	      Make sure to Accept License Agreement in the above site page.

Step 2) Install the jre.exe on all default settings

Step 3) Double Click itch.jar present in the Application directory

😨😱😨   
NOTE:	itch.jar may look like it's not responding if the xlsx file is large and there are a lot of photos.
	Don't worry, it is working in the background. 
	To confirm, you can go to the Destination Folder that you provide in the app. 
	You will be able to see the folder populate itself with folders according to the xlsx file.
